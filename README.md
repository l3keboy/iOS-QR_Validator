# iOS QR Validator
QR Validator is an app which enables you to scan QR-Codes and check the safety of the corresponding URL (Using the Google Safe Browsing API). When a URL is seen as safe, this URL can be opened (or copied, depending on your preferences). When an URL is unsafe, an explanation will be given.<br>
Tested with iOS 15.0 and above with iPhone 8 and newer!
